project name = financial_calculators

description = This was a project in which I programmed a calculator using Python. It would calculate the amount needed to repay for a bond or calculate the value of an investment all dependent on the userâ€™s input.

When running this program you will need to choose between investment or bond.
If you choose investment you will be asked a few questions to calculate the interest you need to pay on your investment:
How much money are you depositng?
Please enter interest rate without symbols?
How many years do you plan on investing?
Do you want 'simple' or 'compound' interest? 

If you choose bond you will be asked a few questions to calculate the amount needed to pay on a home loan.
Please enter the present value of the house e.g. 100000
Please enter interest rate without symbols
How many months will it take for you to repay the bond?
